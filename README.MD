# Fireworks simulation

It's pretty slow because it's made with Python and Pygame.
I'm planning to use NumPy array instead of regular Python list to make it faster.

# Controlls

> space - create firework
> 
> A, D - rotate cannon
> 
> mouse cursor - move cannon

# Needed libraries
```bash
pygame
```
